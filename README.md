# Model-Based Systems Engineering

> "Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases."

**Executive Summary**

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a methodology that uses models to represent and analyze complex systems. This approach aids in the development of systems from concept to operation. It does this by using models to capture the system's requirements, design, behavior, cost, risk, and other aspects.
